This is our project in the course 'Information Visualization' in Haifa University.

This project purpose is to visualize the Steam community with Steam Dataset that was published here : https://steam.internet.byu.edu/ ,
we also used data from a file in a GeoJSON format that was published here : https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/ . 

# Dependencies

Libraries require for our visualizations are located at 
'Code\VisualizingData\Libraries' but internet connection is required due to several CDNs. 
We can assure performance only in Chrome browser. 

# Project Structure
 
More inforamation can be found in the 'ProjectDocumentation' folder regarding:

- How we extract our data (queriesCurrent.txt in the path Code\DerivingData) . 

- The visualizations themselves in the our paper (SteamDatasetVisualization.docx) . 

In the 'Vizualization-SteamDataset\Code\Source' folder, 
One can review our source code and also see the derived data that was extracted
(from both the Steam Dataset and the GeoJSON) and used for the visualizations.
